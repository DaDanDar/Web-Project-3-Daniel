            <h2>The History And Terms Of Treaty One</h2>
            <section>
                <pre>
                        Treaty One, also called the "Stone Fort Treaty," was the first of eleven numbered treaties negotiated between 1871 and 1921. 
                    It was signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry by the Canadian government and the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree peoples 
                    of southern Manitoba. It was signed by government representatives including Lieutenant-Governor Adams G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, 
                    and Major A.G. Irvine, with eight witnesses. The Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree signatories included Red Eagle (Mis-koo-ke-new 
                    or Henry Prince), Bird Forever (Ka-ke-ka-penais or William Pennefather), Flying Down Bird (Na-sha-ke-penais), Centre of Bird's 
                    Tail (Na-na-wa-nanan), Flying Round (Ke-we-tay-ash), Whip-poor-will (Wa-ko-wush), and Yellow Quill (Os-za-we-kwun). From the 
                    Canadian government's perspective, the treaties aimed to promote Western settlement and the assimilation of Indigenous peoples into 
                    Euro-Canadian society. Indigenous peoples viewed the treaties as a way to protect their land and culture, as they seek support in 
                    adapting to new ways of life. Treaty One reflects these conflicting goals, leaving behind unresolved issues due to different 
                    interpretations of the agreement by both parties.

                        The treaty was made official on September 12th, 1871. Each Indigenous band was given a reserve of land with 160 acres per family of five. Each individual 
                    received a one-time payment of three dollars, as well as an annual payment of $15 per family of five. The government also agreed to maintain schools 
                    and ban liquor on these reserves. Then there are the "Outside Promises", The "Outside Promises" were verbal commitments made by Commissioner Wemyss Simpson 
                    to secure signatures for Treaty One after some Indigenous leaders, including Chief Henry Prince, refused to sign without additional assurances. These promises 
                    included providing agricultural tools (plows, harrows), livestock (bulls, cows, boars, sows), and other supplies such as buggies and clothing. However, 
                    these promises were not formally written into the treaty, leading to disputes later on. The government eventually recognized these outside promises in an official 
                    document to honor the verbal commitments.
